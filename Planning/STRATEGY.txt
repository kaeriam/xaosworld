UNDERGROUND MYSPACE 2.0 SOCIAL NETWORK (BUT ACTUALLY SOCIAL)

Y2K is on the rise, TIKTOK is mainstream, algoplatforms are mainstream --> back to chatrooms --> 2000s aesthetic of social media is cool, we can glow this up as a undergroundmusic platform first mixing it with myspace friends features. We onboard undergroundartist who can display their music there, connect closer with their friends, all inside their own aesthetic. 





Key features:

- Music player for each artist 
- start out in all y2k html aesthetic 
- underground chatrooms for community 
- photos need to be downgraded to y2k quality automatically
- artist ranking in profile and on website who has most listeners  

Cool side feature ideas:

- chronological feed like 4chan, (addictive, super entertaining)
- super costumizable personal pages like myspace 
- create a public top8 friends (you can choose) like myspace 
- maybe even create a hardware version of it (like a nokia rplica) that runs this website. 
- maybe restrict AI completely


Research:

Apparently the editing of your site was not meant to be. SOme guy found out you can actually edit it by coding html. So the young people kind of cheated their way to an aesthetic. Which made it cooler obviously. I dont think u can give them an actual editor. Or the editor needs to be hidden for it to make sense.

Security needs to be an important aspect over time. Old aesthetics but modern backend is the key.

Cyberbullying needs to be moderated.

Marketing:

- get underround acts like FENG, FAKEMINK, 2HOLLIS and other underground acts on this.
